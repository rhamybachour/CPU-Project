# CPU-Project
A project done during a oriented-object programming course at the university

# Work Objetive
This work can simulate and analyze the most diverse processing variations of a CPU that works with "single queue" and "multiple queue", in addition to varying the number of processing cores and their total working time, both idle and busy.

# Files

## Desimul.py

It's a definition of some classes that will use on the processors.py file.

## Processors.py

It is where all the functions used in the simulation are defined, with their classes and methods.

## Simulations.ipynb

It contents all the simulations and results. The graphic below shows a example of some results.
